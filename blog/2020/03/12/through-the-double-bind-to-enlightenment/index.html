<div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: "><p><em>(Following from <a href="https://sylvaindarwish.github.io/blog/2020/02/27/double-bind/">previous post</a>)</em></p>

<p>The connection that Bateson and his collaborators sought to establish,
<em>via</em> the concept of the double bind, between metalevel difficulties in
communication and pathologies of relationships gained diffusion within
large publics as it inspired or got integrated into clinical practice in
various currents of psychotherapy in the 1960s and 1970s. Bateson
himself, however, eventually came to express impatience and frustration
at times with the popularity that the double bind hypothesis had
achieved in some psychiatric circles and Euroamerican public culture
(e.g. 1972a). This popularity largely eclipsed and passed over in
silence that <em>there was another side</em> to his inquiries into paradox and
difficulties at the metalevel, and one he considered of much wider
import and relevance &mdash; indeed, he was to argue <em>in fine</em> that
paradoxes of abstraction were central to the evolution of patterns of
relationships in ecosystems, and thus to the natural history of forms of
life itself. This other part of his analysis is quite relevant, I now
want to suggest, for interpreting Yasser&rsquo;s pick of a text that precisely
extols the relationality of &lsquo;kinship&rsquo; or <em>ṣilat al-raḥim</em> by means of
entangling the reader into difficulties at the metalevel.</p>

<p>One would be misguided to project from Bateson&rsquo;s elegant account of the
(sometime) psychic pathogenicity of double binds a longing for
well-ordered, smooth, transparent communication, or to draw from it the
conclusion that we would be better off if only people obeyed in their
everyday communications the rules of formal logic. Not only, Bateson had
to constantly remind his readers, do paradoxes of communication
involving contraction and confusion between multiple types of signals
pervade ordinary exchanges, and do not usually result in anything
regarded as pathological. (In fact, &ldquo;there is nothing&rdquo; in double-bind
theory, he provocatively told the attendees of a psychiatric congress
celebrating its tenth anniversary (1972a: 272), &ldquo;to determine whether a
given individual shall become a clown, a poet, a schizophrenic, or some
combination of these&rdquo;.) Not only were communications entailing
uncertainty as to &lsquo;what sort of message a message is&rsquo; precisely what
make play, humor, art, fantasy, dream, etc. possible, and thus what
drove the exploration of relationship and the evolution of new patterns
of interaction. Bateson also consistently maintained that if the most
acute, painful double binds could drive one into insanity, they also
seemed to be straits one had to go through to force oneself or others
into &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; or &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo;. The original and best-known text on
the double bind thus already contains the early mention &mdash; curious, on
the face of it, in a psychiatry article &mdash; of a Zen master holding a
stick over a pupil&rsquo;s head and declaring: &ldquo;If you say this stick is real,
I will strike you with it. If you say this stick is not real, I will
strike you with it. If you don&rsquo;t say anything, I will strike you with
it.&rdquo; Bateson adds that &ldquo;the schizophrenic finds himself continually in
the same situation as the pupil, but he achieves disorientation <em>rather
than enlightenment</em>&rdquo; (1972: 208, emphasis added).</p>

<p>The reference is to the pedagogy of the <em>koan</em> in the Zen tradition,
specifically in the Japanese Rinzai school of Zen. To put it briefly, a
<em>koan</em> (lit., &lsquo;public record&rsquo;) is a case or &ldquo;problem&rdquo; that the Zen
master presents to a student for her to concentrate her mind upon and
resolve (Suzuki 1963). It often &mdash; but not always &mdash; takes the form of
an insurmountable paradox, as in the example given by Bateson, or the
demand to &ldquo;let me hear the sound of one hand clapping.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This paradox
is to bring the student&rsquo;s mind into such tension that it suddenly opens
onto a different and more expansive state of consciousness, to which the
mind could not come left to its own habits of thinking. &ldquo;When the <em>koan</em>
is resolves, it is realized to be a simple and clear statement made from
the state of consciousness which it has helped to awaken&rdquo; (Miura and
Fuller Sasaki 1965: xi-xii). In the case mentioned by Bateson, such a
resolution on the part of the student could mean (and has meant)
grabbing the stick away from the master, breaking it into two, and
walking away &mdash; not just from the master&rsquo;s impossible demand to &ldquo;say
something&rdquo;, but also from wasting her mind in a muddle of metaphysical
questions, from the misleading reifications internal to human language,
and from obedience itself as the yardstick by which to know how to live
one&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Bateson frequently referred over the years to the Zen tradition, usually
in discussions of learning and habit.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> His companionship with Zen had
a lot to do with the recognition in this tradition that facing up to
(rather than avoiding) the double binds that naturally arise in complex
forms of life was a necessary pathway to &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; or &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo;.
Bateson called this mode of learning through staying with and engaging
difficulties at the metalevel Learning III, &ldquo;in which there is a
profound reorganization of character&rdquo;, as opposed to Learning II, in
which we learn and habituate ourselves to the contexts of life presented
to us (1972c). He also observed that Learning III was &ldquo;difficult and
rare even among human beings&rdquo; and that expecting it &ldquo;of some men and
some mammals is sometimes pathogenic&rdquo;. In Learning II, we learn the
contexts of life: we learn, that is, to &ldquo;punctuate&rdquo; events into a
contextual structure, schemes for putting the information together. We
learn, usually through trial and error, that <em>this</em> I am a part of right
now is a case or context for, say, being romantic, enacting kinship, or
playing fetch. In doing so, we also learn the implicit premises or
propositions that govern punctuation, the background assumptions of this
or that context of life, and commit them to the unconscious of habit.
These implicit and habituated premises can be of various order of
generality, from &ldquo;the soul is separate from the body and can control it&rdquo;
to &ldquo;a good girl never says &lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rdquo; to premises relative to the history of
individuals in relationship (&ldquo;A has a debt towards B&rdquo;) &mdash;, and they primarily
make sense under the restricted circumstances of the context of life
they underwrite: having absorbed and committed them to habit, I will
mold the context of interaction to fit the punctuation of events, the
way of putting together the information in front of me, that I previous
learned to recognize and participate in. For this reason, they also
become self-validating, and this and habituation make them hard to
unlearn, however maladaptive they may (and frequently prove to) be under
other, or changed, or larger circumstances.</p>

<p>Life (and people, and institutions) presents us with double binds, or
with difficulties at the metalevel, when the premises we learned in one
context of life prove to be at odds with the premises internal to
another, successive or larger context of life: when the premise &ldquo;it is
important to participate in academic conferences for professional
development&rdquo;, for example, is at odds with the premise that &ldquo;air travel
GHG emissions must be reduced urgently for the planet to remain
habitable&rdquo;. The most common inclination in the face of this type of
dissonances are attempts to avoid or manage them, in a manner that will
entail oscillations, pain as we saw before, and in the end breakdown or
disintegration. What seemed to fascinate Bateson in the Zen tradition of
the <em>koan</em> is the avoidance of the avoidance of dissonance. The Zen
pedagogy of the <em>koan</em> does not aim at managing dissonance. It
deliberately organizes confrontations with difficulties at the metalevel
as a method for the student to revise or unlearn self-validating,
habituated epistemological premises acquired from previously learned
contexts of life and, in the end, relevant to them and to them only. For
the two <em>koans</em> I mentioned above, the student could come to change her
relation to language &mdash; come to see that her sense of reality has
always been dependent on tropes chopped out of interactive sequences and
sedimented in language. Or she could end up learning from the master
that obedience or faithfulness to the master will not indicate to her
how to live a life like the master&rsquo;s. In the process, unexamined
premises will be thrown open to question and change, there will be a
collapsing of what had been previously learned and habituated, and a
profound reorganization of one&rsquo;s contexts of life in the direction of a larger, more encompassing context. For Bateson, at the end of this arduous kind of learning, there could be the revelation of &ldquo;a simplicity in which hunger leads directly to eating&rdquo;. There could also be &ldquo;a world in which personal identity merges into all the processes of relationship in some vast ecology or aesthetics of cosmic interaction&rdquo; &mdash; the power and innocence
&ldquo;to see&rdquo;, in a Blakean fashion, &ldquo;the World in a Grain of Sand&rdquo; (1972c:
306).</p>
