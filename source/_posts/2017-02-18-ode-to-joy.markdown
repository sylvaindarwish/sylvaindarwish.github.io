I am buying an espresso at Abu Naji's, a coffee stand/minimarket on Bliss street. I have not showered because there was no hot water at home, and I am wearing a beanie and a buff that I use when hiking because it is very cold today. Ba'ash, the employee in charge of sandwiches who is Palestinian from Sabra tells me: 

"You look like Beethoven."

Which, as a matter of fact, is true. 

It's from one incarnation of the whiteman to the next I guess.
