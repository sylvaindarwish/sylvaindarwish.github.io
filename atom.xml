<p>The connection that Bateson and his collaborators sought to establish,
<em>via</em> the concept of the double bind, between metalevel difficulties in
communication and pathologies of relationships gained diffusion within
large publics as it inspired or got integrated into clinical practice in
various currents of psychotherapy in the 1960s and 1970s. Bateson
himself, however, eventually came to express impatience and frustration
at times with the popularity that the double bind hypothesis had
achieved in some psychiatric circles and Euroamerican public culture
(e.g. 1972a). This popularity largely eclipsed and passed over in
silence that <em>there was another side</em> to his inquiries into paradox and
difficulties at the metalevel, and one he considered of much wider
import and relevance &mdash; indeed, he was to argue <em>in fine</em> that
paradoxes of abstraction were central to the evolution of patterns of
relationships in ecosystems, and thus to the natural history of forms of
life itself. This other part of his analysis is quite relevant, I now
want to suggest, for interpreting Yasser&rsquo;s pick of a text that precisely
extols the relationality of &lsquo;kinship&rsquo; or <em>ṣilat al-raḥim</em> by means of
entangling the reader into difficulties at the metalevel.</p>

<p>One would be misguided to project from Bateson&rsquo;s elegant account of the
(sometime) psychic pathogenicity of double binds a longing for
well-ordered, smooth, transparent communication, or to draw from it the
conclusion that we would be better off if only people obeyed in their
everyday communications the rules of formal logic. Not only, Bateson had
to constantly remind his readers, do paradoxes of communication
involving contraction and confusion between multiple types of signals
pervade ordinary exchanges, and do not usually result in anything
regarded as pathological. (In fact, &ldquo;there is nothing&rdquo; in double-bind
theory, he provocatively told the attendees of a psychiatric congress
celebrating its tenth anniversary (1972a: 272), &ldquo;to determine whether a
given individual shall become a clown, a poet, a schizophrenic, or some
combination of these&rdquo;.) Not only were communications entailing
uncertainty as to &lsquo;what sort of message a message is&rsquo; precisely what
make play, humor, art, fantasy, dream, etc. possible, and thus what
drove the exploration of relationship and the evolution of new patterns
of interaction. Bateson also consistently maintained that if the most
acute, painful double binds could drive one into insanity, they also
seemed to be straits one had to go through to force oneself or others
into &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; or &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo;. The original and best-known text on
the double bind thus already contains the early mention &mdash; curious, on
the face of it, in a psychiatry article &mdash; of a Zen master holding a
stick over a pupil&rsquo;s head and declaring: &ldquo;If you say this stick is real,
I will strike you with it. If you say this stick is not real, I will
strike you with it. If you don&rsquo;t say anything, I will strike you with
it.&rdquo; Bateson adds that &ldquo;the schizophrenic finds himself continually in
the same situation as the pupil, but he achieves disorientation <em>rather
than enlightenment</em>&rdquo; (1972: 208, emphasis added).</p>

<p>The reference is to the pedagogy of the <em>koan</em> in the Zen tradition,
specifically in the Japanese Rinzai school of Zen. To put it briefly, a
<em>koan</em> (lit., &lsquo;public record&rsquo;) is a case or &ldquo;problem&rdquo; that the Zen
master presents to a student for her to concentrate her mind upon and
resolve (Suzuki 1963). It often &mdash; but not always &mdash; takes the form of
an insurmountable paradox, as in the example given by Bateson, or the
demand to &ldquo;let me hear the sound of one hand clapping.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This paradox
is to bring the student&rsquo;s mind into such tension that it suddenly opens
onto a different and more expansive state of consciousness, to which the
mind could not come left to its own habits of thinking. &ldquo;When the <em>koan</em>
is resolves, it is realized to be a simple and clear statement made from
the state of consciousness which it has helped to awaken&rdquo; (Miura and
Fuller Sasaki 1965: xi-xii). In the case mentioned by Bateson, such a
resolution on the part of the student could mean (and has meant)
grabbing the stick away from the master, breaking it into two, and
walking away &mdash; not just from the master&rsquo;s impossible demand to &ldquo;say
something&rdquo;, but also from wasting her mind in a muddle of metaphysical
questions, from the misleading reifications internal to human language,
and from obedience itself as the yardstick by which to know how to live
one&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Bateson frequently referred over the years to the Zen tradition, usually
in discussions of learning and habit.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> His companionship with Zen had
a lot to do with the recognition in this tradition that facing up to
(rather than avoiding) the double binds that naturally arise in complex
forms of life was a necessary pathway to &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; or &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo;.
Bateson called this mode of learning through staying with and engaging
difficulties at the metalevel Learning III, &ldquo;in which there is a
profound reorganization of character&rdquo;, as opposed to Learning II, in
which we learn and habituate ourselves to the contexts of life presented
to us (1972c). He also observed that Learning III was &ldquo;difficult and
rare even among human beings&rdquo; and that expecting it &ldquo;of some men and
some mammals is sometimes pathogenic&rdquo;. In Learning II, we learn the
contexts of life: we learn, that is, to &ldquo;punctuate&rdquo; events into a
contextual structure, schemes for putting the information together. We
learn, usually through trial and error, that <em>this</em> I am a part of right
now is a case or context for, say, being romantic, enacting kinship, or
playing fetch. In doing so, we also learn the implicit premises or
propositions that govern punctuation, the background assumptions of this
or that context of life, and commit them to the unconscious of habit.
These implicit and habituated premises can be of various order of
generality, from &ldquo;the soul is separate from the body and can control it&rdquo;
to &ldquo;a good girl never says &lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rdquo; to premises relative to the history of
individuals in relationship (&ldquo;A has a debt towards B&rdquo;) &mdash;, and they primarily
make sense under the restricted circumstances of the context of life
they underwrite: having absorbed and committed them to habit, I will
mold the context of interaction to fit the punctuation of events, the
way of putting together the information in front of me, that I previous
learned to recognize and participate in. For this reason, they also
become self-validating, and this and habituation make them hard to
unlearn, however maladaptive they may (and frequently prove to) be under
other, or changed, or larger circumstances.</p>

<p>Life (and people, and institutions) presents us with double binds, or
with difficulties at the metalevel, when the premises we learned in one
context of life prove to be at odds with the premises internal to
another, successive or larger context of life: when the premise &ldquo;it is
important to participate in academic conferences for professional
development&rdquo;, for example, is at odds with the premise that &ldquo;air travel
GHG emissions must be reduced urgently for the planet to remain
habitable&rdquo;. The most common inclination in the face of this type of
dissonances are attempts to avoid or manage them, in a manner that will
entail oscillations, pain as we saw before, and in the end breakdown or
disintegration. What seemed to fascinate Bateson in the Zen tradition of
the <em>koan</em> is the avoidance of the avoidance of dissonance. The Zen
pedagogy of the <em>koan</em> does not aim at managing dissonance. It
deliberately organizes confrontations with difficulties at the metalevel
as a method for the student to revise or unlearn self-validating,
habituated epistemological premises acquired from previously learned
contexts of life and, in the end, relevant to them and to them only. For
the two <em>koans</em> I mentioned above, the student could come to change her
relation to language &mdash; come to see that her sense of reality has
always been dependent on tropes chopped out of interactive sequences and
sedimented in language. Or she could end up learning from the master
that obedience or faithfulness to the master will not indicate to her
how to live a life like the master&rsquo;s. In the process, unexamined
premises will be thrown open to question and change, there will be a
collapsing of what had been previously learned and habituated, and a
profound reorganization of one&rsquo;s contexts of life in the direction of a larger, more encompassing context. For Bateson, at the end of this arduous kind of learning, there could be the revelation of &ldquo;a simplicity in which hunger leads directly to eating&rdquo;. There could also be &ldquo;a world in which personal identity merges into all the processes of relationship in some vast ecology or aesthetics of cosmic interaction&rdquo; &mdash; the power and innocence
&ldquo;to see&rdquo;, in a Blakean fashion, &ldquo;the World in a Grain of Sand&rdquo; (1972c:
306).</p>

    <updated>2020-02-27T09:58:30+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://sylvaindarwish.github.io/blog/2020/02/27/double-bind</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bateson developed his analytic of the radical disorientation attendant
to &ldquo;difficulties at the metalevel&rdquo; while working with patients diagnosed
as schizophrenic in a Palo Alto hospital in the 1950s. This research
project famously led to the double bind hypothesis (Bateson et al. 1972;
Chaney 2017: 45-63). According to this hypothesis, the schizophrenic&rsquo;s
condition originated in one particular, human variant of the (logical)
&ldquo;paradoxes of abstraction&rdquo; that pervade and constantly find their way
into &ldquo;the mental process and communicative habits of mammals&rdquo; at large
(1972: 180). Such paradoxes arise from condensation and contradiction
within the hierarchy of &ldquo;levels&rdquo; or &ldquo;modes&rdquo; of communication on which
depends the possibility to know, precisely, &ldquo;what kind of message a
message is&rdquo;. For a message to be interpreted felicitously, it must me
accompanied by a metamessage &mdash; another, and one degree more abstract,
&ldquo;class of information&rdquo; (1979: 115) &mdash; labeling the message as, for
instance, literal, metaphoric, playful, humorous, dead serious,
ritualistic, fiction etc. One ordinary example of paradox of
abstraction, then, would be a message (say, &ldquo;take me into your arms&rdquo;),
framed or reframed by a metasignal (the speaker&rsquo;s body stiffens as she
receives the hug she requested just moments earlier) that casts
uncertainty onto whether and how the message was meant (1972: 217).
Bateson wrote elsewhere and often of the <em>pain</em> (and even of the
&ldquo;extreme pain&rdquo;) that can be inflicted on humans (and on dogs, and on
dolphins) through exposing them to such paradoxes (e.g. 1972: 241-2,
246, 278, 478, 1979: 118-123). For him, withdrawal from linguistic and
bodily communication (catatonia), flight into distrustful, delusional
interpretation (paranoia), or into disorganized thought and discourse
crammed with unlabeled metaphors (hebephrenia, &ldquo;word salad&rdquo;) were not
adequately described as symptoms of a mental disorder ascribable to (or
locatable in) a bounded self. Rather, they were adaptive dispositions,
acquired or learned in a dynamic dialog with a larger life environment,
and &ldquo;in some sense appropriate&rdquo; (1972: 206) to dampen the repeated
experience of the pain generated by paradoxes of abstraction. Those
dispositions or &ldquo;unconventional communicative habits&rdquo; were particularly
prone to develop when a young human grew up within an early
communication system (typically, amongst close kin) in which routine
contradictions or lack of clarity in the labeling of exchanged messages
made it extraordinarily difficult for her to know what sort of message
was being communicated &mdash; while, at the same time, <em>any</em> interpretation
exposed her to rebuke or punishment for being unsound. The accumulated
effect of such &ldquo;unresolvable sequences of experiences&rdquo; (<em>ibid.</em>) could
be a breakdown, rather than development, of the child&rsquo;s communicative
system, a learned incapacity to discriminate &ldquo;what sort of message a
message is&rdquo; (including for interpreting the messages internal to her own
thought and emotional processes), and withdrawal or flight into one form
or the other of psychic seclusion. One may well remember here Arendt&rsquo;s
formulation of worldliness as a material-semiotic horizon ahead of us,
for example, her claim that &ldquo;<em>with word and deed we insert ourselves
into the human world</em>, and this insertion is like a second birth, in
which we confirm and take upon ourselves the naked fact of our original
physical appearance&rdquo; (1958). While Bateson himself does not use this
language, the victim of the double bind was, perhaps, forced or kept in
his analysis into a form of worldlessness.</p>

    <link href="http://sylvaindarwish.github.io/blog/2019/07/03/who-am-i-to-you/"/>
    <updated>2019-07-03T17:00:04+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://sylvaindarwish.github.io/blog/2019/07/03/who-am-i-to-you</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One simple but profound observation I feel I finally understood from Bateson today is the following. In any kind of communication the question: who am I to you? who are you to me? is at stake.</p>

<p>And there is no escaping this, this is so even if the communication is ostensibly &lsquo;just&rsquo; about the transmission of information about something else. That is, the transmission of information is always, has to be, also transmission of information about the relationship.</p>

<p>Otherwise (if there is no transmission of information also about the relationship), then there can no be no transmission of information, even about something else, in such a way that this information can be interpreted, can make sense at all.</p>

<p>At least this is so for communication between mammals. But then, for human mammals, it has to be a very dangerous game.</p>

<p>The dog — she pretty much only communicates with me about the variations of our relationship and very little about anything else.</p>

<p>Even behaviors to the effect of &lsquo;I want to play frisbee&rsquo; or &lsquo;I like it so much when you dry me with a towel&rsquo; — it looks like it is about (it stands for, manifests) something else (&lsquo;tastes&rsquo;, forms of enjoyment) but it is fundamentally about a &ldquo;you and me in the world&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Whereas for human mammals, it becomes very hazardous precisely because they can transmit information apparently autonomous from the relationship (i.e. from the ongoing exchange), yet even that has to, and will, carry information about the relationship.</p>

<p>I can think of at least three variations of how it becomes gut-wrenching. One is when we think, in good faith, that we talk about something else, something autonomous from the state of the relationship, and we inadvertently destroy the relationship.</p>

<p>This one, the one variation I just mentioned, it&rsquo;s something that can and should be worked upon (tactfulness, I guess) although it will probably happen to everybody one day.</p>

<p>Another one is the communication of pain between, for example, relatives. As my friend Nabil says, &ldquo;to your mother, even if you&rsquo;re on the verge of dying, you must say &lsquo;I feel strong like a horse!&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The other one is when we feel a bit unclear about where or who we are, we think (or are told) that trying to articulate it in language will help, but it will not necessarily do that in fact since the &lsquo;who I am&rsquo; is always, has to be, a &lsquo;who I am to you&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I would guess that it is so even in a psychotherapist&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p>This is why, I guess, communication with and between nonhuman mammals can strike us as so poor and so rich, or so full, at the same time. They cannot seduce themselves into the &lsquo;who am I&rsquo; kind of communication, and the dark labyrinths it opens, it&rsquo;s always &lsquo;who am I to you&rsquo;, period.</p>

<p>This is probably an example of discovering the Mediterranean sea as the Spaniards say, or at least it&rsquo;s what I remember reading they say.</p>

    <link href="http://sylvaindarwish.github.io/blog/2018/06/14/worldliness/"/>
    <updated>2018-06-14T12:06:50+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://sylvaindarwish.github.io/blog/2018/06/14/worldliness</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[…]</p>

<p>By onto-ethics of worldliness, I mean, for now, a broad but specific
register of the ethical life anchored in a sense, or hunch, that the
self&rsquo;s relation to the world could and should be more admirable, more
far-reaching, and more wittingly reciprocal, than it is in the present.
Such an ethics presupposes an original orientation to self and world
that does not see their consociation as fixed but rather apprehends both
of them as unfinished and co-emergent. It also entails the apprehension
of a tendency running counter to this orientation in the human self, a
disposition to be out of kilter with the world, or a comfort found in a
state of relative alienation from it.</p>

<p>To be sure, the type of incipient striving towards worldliness I am
painting here with broad strokes can be, and has been, interpreted,
intensified and socially absorbed through very diverse and at times
divergent configurations of ethical life. In the Euroamerican
philosophical tradition, many will associate the concept of worldliness
with the major and quite distinct elaboration it received in the
twentieth century in the thought and writings of Hannah Arendt (1958a,
1978). Worldliness is, in one of her commentators' words, &ldquo;what Arendt
prizes most&rdquo; (Kateb 1977: 142), that of which the ever increasing
impracticability informs her critical diagnosis of the modern age, and
that of which the restoration orients her political and moral theory.
For Arendt, worldliness anchors itself as the highest pursuit in the
existential condition of <em>natality</em>: the &ldquo;naked fact&rdquo; of one&rsquo;s
&ldquo;appearance&rdquo; into being, which presupposes an immanent power to appear
and thus also the &ldquo;appearingness&rdquo; of other beings recipients of my
appearance (1978: 19-23, 1958a: 175-181). Every living entity&rsquo;s
appearance, in this Arendtian sense, is an ontological event that makes
sensible in the present an as yet indeterminate future in which this
entity will have been seen, heard, and otherwise pulled &ldquo;out of the
darkness of sheltered existence&rdquo; by other entities that it will have
similarly grasped and engaged in various ways (1958a:
175-181). This material-semiotic &ldquo;play&rdquo; (1978: 22) of
appearances is what Arendt called &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; which thus emerges and
lies, in her formulation, &ldquo;in-between&rdquo; (<em>inter-esse</em>) the entities that
appear to each other.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://sylvaindarwish.github.io/images/photos/papa.jpg" title="[title:&#34;&#34;]" alt="[title:&#34;&#34;]"></p>

<p>This is a picture of my father, François Perdigon, who died by taking his own life this week 26 years ago. The plump, wide-eyed puppy sitting on his lap is me at the age of 0. I&rsquo;m posting this here, including the manner of his death, for two reasons. One is that this year, now, is the last year that I pass this anniversary while still younger than he was when he decided to end his life — next year I will remember the manner of his death as the choice of a relative ever younger than I am — and there is an overwhelming sense of impending transformation, and vertigo (and a bit of fear) that goes with that, of a life-threshold for me, not unlike other life-passages (weddings, graduations, etc.) which are made more real, including to ourselves, through being ritually shared with others, on the web amongst other places. I&rsquo;m remembering Hannah, too: &ldquo;Compared with the reality which comes from being seen and heard, even the greatest forces of intimate life — the passions of the heart, the thoughts of the mind, the delights of the senses — lead an uncertain, shadowy existence unless and until they are transformed, deprivatized and desindividualized, as it were, into a shape to fit them for public appearance.&rdquo; The other reason is that, frankly, as I&rsquo;m reaching this old age, I am also growing tired and impatient with the etiquette of silence surrounding suicide within kinship, or the assumption that only traumatic or traumatized discourse can happen in its wake. Making it visible as I&rsquo;m doing now is brutal, but keeping silent about it is brutal too, and not just for the one who keeps silent. So here is a small experiment, in mourning and remembering. Surely there should be a way to celebrate the natality and passage through the world of even those whose final act speaks poorly of natality, of the world, and perhaps of themselves, the possibility of an effort to make them, still, ancestors rather than ghosts.</p>

<p>I still apologize if you found this post brutal. (It&rsquo;s good, at least, that I have this space to do that, rather than being tempted to write one of those ghastly French papa-maman novels that Deleuze abhorred so much.)</p>

In short, the subject must learn to rely for survival on her provisionality within any one unfolding discursive space and her displacement across discursive spaces as her means of survival. In doing so, she places herself in the human lot: Every day, without relief from birth to death, she will remake the here and now whether she likes it or not, whether she knows it or not, in the context of institutional threat and incitement.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am buying an espresso at Abu Naji&rsquo;s, a coffee stand/minimarket on Bliss street. I have not showered because there was no hot water at home, and I am wearing a beanie and a buff that I use when hiking because it is very cold today. Ba'ash, the employee in charge of sandwiches who is Palestinian from Sabra tells me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look like Beethoven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which, as a matter of fact, is true.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s from one incarnation of the whiteman to the next I guess.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The capitalistic economy of the present day is an immense cosmos into which the individual is born, and which presents itself to him, at least as an individual, as an unalterable order of things in which he must live. It forces the individual, in so far as he is involved in the system of market relationships, to conform to capitalistic rules of action. The manufacturer who in the long run acts counter to these norms, will just as inevitably be eliminated from the economic scene as the worker who cannot or will not adapt himself to them will be thrown into the streets without a job.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Not very many kinds of other-than-human critters have convinced human skeptics that the animals recognize themselves in a mirror—a talent made known to scientists by such actions as picking at paint spots or other marks on one’s body that are visible only in a mirror. Pigeons share this capacity with, at least, human children over two years old, rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, magpies, dolphins, and elephants […] Pigeons passed their  first mirror tests in the laboratories of B. F. Skinner in 1981. In 2008, <em>Science News</em> reported that Keio University researchers showed that, even with  five- to seven-second time delays, pigeons did better at self-recognition tests with both mirrors and live video images of themselves than three-year-old human children. Pigeons pick out different people in photographs very well too, and in Professor Shigeru Watanabe’s Laboratory of Comparative Cognitive Neuroscience at Keio University, pigeons could tell the difference between paintings by Monet or Picasso, and even generalize to discriminate unfamiliar paintings from different styles and schools by various painters.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>William James on will (in <em>Varieties of Religious Experience</em>):</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we drop abstractions and take what we call our will in the act, we see that it is a very complex function. It involves both stimulations and inhibitions; it follows generalized habits; it is escorted by reflective criticisms; and it leaves a good or a bad taste of itself behind, according to the manner of the performance. The result is that, quite apart from the immediate pleasure which any sensible experience may give us, our own general moral attitude in procuring or undergoing the experience brings with it a secondary satisfaction or distaste. Some men and women, indeed, there are who can live on smiles and the word “yes” forever. But for others (indeed for most), this is too tepid and relaxed a moral climate. Passive happiness is slack and insipid, and soon grows mawkish and intolerable. Some austerity and wintry negativity, some roughness, danger, stringency, and effort, some “no! no!” must be mixed in, to produce the sense of an existence with character and texture and power. The range of individual differences in this respect is enormous; but whatever the mixture of yeses and noes may be, the person is infallibly aware when he has struck it in the right proportion FOR HIM. This, he feels, is my proper vocation, this is the OPTIMUM, the law, the life for me to live. Here I find the degree of equilibrium, safety, calm, and leisure which I need, or here I find the challenge, passion, fight, and hardship without which my soul’s energy expires.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Ṣilat al-Raḥim : Kinship, Birth and the Pursuit of Worldliness in a Palestinian refugee community</em> (<em>SAR</em>) builds on a paradox that binds birth, kinship and worldliness for long-term refugees. Obligations between kin can and are often reflexively interpreted as reverberations of the gift and debt of an individual&rsquo;s birth or appearance into the world. The <em>thisness</em> of kinship ties, in this basic sense, presupposes the prior presence, and amenability, of a world into which to be born and dwell. Refugees, however, come into being with arts of governmentality that disjoin birth from the world. Citizenship laws typically minimize their share of the ordinary modes of practical involvement by way of which worldly reality, and worldly selves, are made to appear for full subjects of the state. <em>SAR</em> traces everyday events by way of which kinship ties acquire shape, substance and force as refractions of birth for Palestinian men and women divested, by law, of much of a world into which to appear, and it explores the paradoxical figurations of worldliness that such events and relations entail.</p>
