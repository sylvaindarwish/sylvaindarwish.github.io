  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: "><p>[…]</p>

<p>By onto-ethics of worldliness, I mean, for now, a broad but specific
register of the ethical life anchored in a sense, or hunch, that the
self&rsquo;s relation to the world could and should be more admirable, more
far-reaching, and more wittingly reciprocal, than it is in the present.
Such an ethics presupposes an original orientation to self and world
that does not see their consociation as fixed but rather apprehends both
of them as unfinished and co-emergent. It also entails the apprehension
of a tendency running counter to this orientation in the human self, a
disposition to be out of kilter with the world, or a comfort found in a
state of relative alienation from it.</p>

<p>To be sure, the type of incipient striving towards worldliness I am
painting here with broad strokes can be, and has been, interpreted,
intensified and socially absorbed through very diverse and at times
divergent configurations of ethical life. In the Euroamerican
philosophical tradition, many will associate the concept of worldliness
with the major and quite distinct elaboration it received in the
twentieth century in the thought and writings of Hannah Arendt (1958a,
1978). Worldliness is, in one of her commentators' words, &ldquo;what Arendt
prizes most&rdquo; (Kateb 1977: 142), that of which the ever increasing
impracticability informs her critical diagnosis of the modern age, and
that of which the restoration orients her political and moral theory.
For Arendt, worldliness anchors itself as the highest pursuit in the
existential condition of <em>natality</em>: the &ldquo;naked fact&rdquo; of one&rsquo;s
&ldquo;appearance&rdquo; into being, which presupposes an immanent power to appear
and thus also the &ldquo;appearingness&rdquo; of other beings recipients of my
appearance (1978: 19-23, 1958a: 175-181). Every living entity&rsquo;s
appearance, in this Arendtian sense, is an ontological event that makes
sensible in the present an as yet indeterminate future in which this
entity will have been seen, heard, and otherwise pulled &ldquo;out of the
darkness of sheltered existence&rdquo; by other entities that it will have
similarly grasped and engaged in various ways (1958a:
175-181). This material-semiotic &ldquo;play&rdquo; (1978: 22) of
appearances is what Arendt called &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; which thus emerges and
lies, in her formulation, &ldquo;in-between&rdquo; (<em>inter-esse</em>) the entities that
appear to each other.</p>

<p>This is a picture of my father, François Perdigon, who died by taking his own life this week 26 years ago. The plump, wide-eyed puppy sitting on his lap is me at the age of 0. I&rsquo;m posting this here, including the manner of his death, for two reasons. One is that this year, now, is the last year that I pass this anniversary while still younger than he was when he decided to end his life — next year I will remember the manner of his death as the choice of a relative ever younger than I am — and there is an overwhelming sense of impending transformation, and vertigo (and a bit of fear) that goes with that, of a life-threshold for me, not unlike other life-passages (weddings, graduations, etc.) which are made more real, including to ourselves, through being ritually shared with others, on the web amongst other places. I&rsquo;m remembering Hannah, too: &ldquo;Compared with the reality which comes from being seen and heard, even the greatest forces of intimate life — the passions of the heart, the thoughts of the mind, the delights of the senses — lead an uncertain, shadowy existence unless and until they are transformed, deprivatized and desindividualized, as it were, into a shape to fit them for public appearance.&rdquo; The other reason is that, frankly, as I&rsquo;m reaching this old age, I am also growing tired and impatient with the etiquette of silence surrounding suicide within kinship, or the assumption that only traumatic or traumatized discourse can happen in its wake. Making it visible as I&rsquo;m doing now is brutal, but keeping silent about it is brutal too, and not just for the one who keeps silent. So here is a small experiment, in mourning and remembering. Surely there should be a way to celebrate the natality and passage through the world of even those whose final act speaks poorly of natality, of the world, and perhaps of themselves, the possibility of an effort to make them, still, ancestors rather than ghosts.</p>

<p>I still apologize if you found this post brutal. (It&rsquo;s good, at least, that I have this space to do that, rather than being tempted to write one of those ghastly French papa-maman novels that Deleuze abhorred so much.)</p>

In short, the subject must learn to rely for survival on her provisionality within any one unfolding discursive space and her displacement across discursive spaces as her means of survival. In doing so, she places herself in the human lot: Every day, without relief from birth to death, she will remake the here and now whether she likes it or not, whether she knows it or not, in the context of institutional threat and incitement.</p>

It forces the individual, in so far as he is involved in the system of market relationships, to conform to capitalistic rules of action. The manufacturer who in the long run acts counter to these norms, will just as inevitably be eliminated from the economic scene as the worker who cannot or will not adapt himself to them will be thrown into the streets without a job.&rdquo;</p>
